# Script to inject static environment variables in svelte build at runtime.
# Svelte allows to import environment variables either statically or dynamically, the later coming with optimization
# caveats - public variables have to be sent over http to the client.
#
# we build the application within the docker image directly. With this workflow, we cannot use static environment
# variables unless we know them when building the docker image itself. However, the pattern we seek is for env
# to be set when mounting the Docker image (aka after the build phase but before the container is running).
#
# By default svelte would require us to use dynamic variables (since the client is already built), but we use this
# script as a little hack to interpolate static environment variables at, technically, runtime (while mounting the
# container).
#
# To interpolate a variable on mount, simply populate it statically with the `RUNTIME_` prefix
# (eg: MY_VAR="RUNTIME_MY_VAR"). This lets the script know another value is expected, and since this should run as
# part of the entrypoint, our values should be properly updated before running the node server.
